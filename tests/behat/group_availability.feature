  @javascript
  Scenario: A scheduler that is restricted to a single group
    When I follow "Test scheduler"
    Then I should see "Student 1" in the "studentstoschedule" "table"
    And I should see "Student 2" in the "studentstoschedule" "table"
    And I should see "Student 3" in the "studentstoschedule" "table"
    
    When I click on "Edit settings" "link" in the "Administration" "block"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "Group" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I set the field with xpath "//select[@name='id']" to "Group 2"
    And I press "Save and display"
    Then I should not see "Student 1" in the "studentstoschedule" "table"
    And I should see "Student 2" in the "studentstoschedule" "table"
    And I should not see "Student 3" in the "studentstoschedule" "table"
