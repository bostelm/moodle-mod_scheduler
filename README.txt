"Add slot" and "Edit slot" forms refactored, now based on Moodle Forms.
Language packs migrated to AMOS, removed from plugin codebase.

--- Version 2.3 ---

Intended for Moodle 2.3 and later; no major functional changes, but API adapted and minor enhancements.

--- Version 2.0 --- 

No major functional changes over 1.9; bug fixes and API migration only. Requires 1.9 for database upgrades.  


=== Technical notes ===

The code of this module is rather old, much of it predates even Moodle 1.9.
It has partially been adapted to the new APIs. The following aspects have been migrated,
that is, malfunction in this respect should be considered a bug:

* Gradebook integration
* Moodle 2 backup
* New rich text editor and file API (activity intro and slot add/edit forms) 
* Localization / language packs

The module does not use any deprecated API as of Moodle 2.5.
